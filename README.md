# **Data Analysis Skills Class – Group Project 2**

Welcome to the repository for Group 19's project in the Data Analysis Skills class. As part of the formal analysis for this project, a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) will be used to analyse a given dataset. An outline of the project and its steps can be found below.

## Overview

Our dataset includes information on animals admitted to shelters, such as the type of animal, intake and outcome types, chip status, and length of stay. Our analysis aims to explore the variables affecting the duration of time an animal stays in the shelter before a decision is made about its future.

## Project Tasks

Which factors influence the number of days an animal spends in the shelter before their final outcome is
decided?

### Data Processing

- Load the dataset and examine its structure. 
- Look for any missing values and take appropriate action.
- To prepare variables for analysis

### Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Use boxplots and histograms to visualise the distribution of the variable "time_at_shelter."
- Examine how "time_at_shelter" is distributed among various categories, including animal type, intake type, outcome type, and chip status.

### Generalised Linear Model (GLM)

- Create a GLM model to fit the 'time_at_shelter' count data.
- Interpret the model's coefficients 

## Repository Contents

- Dataset: dataset19.csv
- Code: R scripts for data processing, EDA, and GLM analysis.
- Plots: Visualisations generated during the analysis.
